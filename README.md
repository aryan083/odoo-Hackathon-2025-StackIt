# StackIt - A Minimal Q&A Forum Platform

## 🧠 Problem Statement

StackIt aims to simplify the online Q&A experience for learners, educators, and developers. Most existing platforms are feature-heavy, cluttered, and overwhelming for newcomers. StackIt solves this by focusing only on the core functionalities: **asking questions**, **answering**, **voting**, and **collaborating** - without distractions.

This project addresses **Problem Statement 2**: Building a collaborative forum that supports rich content, structured tagging, and interaction through notifications, all in a lightweight interface.
